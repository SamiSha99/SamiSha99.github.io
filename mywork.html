            <p>It's considered my "first big mod" project, a mod that tries only adds an environmental mechanic which gives speed and a jump boost and powers focused around ice or fire.</p>
            <p>the level is fast paced so the player suppose to utilize these mechancis to overcome the level as fast as possible.</p> 
            <p>During the development I've made a small demo which got a lot of feedback, both positive and negative, the feedback has helped in improving the main mod itself.</p>

            <p>Ever since High School I have done web development as a school project for a website using HTML4 (where I've used the css inside "&lt;style&gt;" ðŸ˜¬).</p>
            <p>But in all honesty, that was just the beginning, after graduating from High School in 2017 I've taken a 16 week Web Dev bootcamp called "Founders & Coders" in Nazareth, in the course I've been taught the fundementals of web development while expanding onto web frameworks like React, Node and Elm.</p>
