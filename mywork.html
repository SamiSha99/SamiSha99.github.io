            <h1>Modding</h1>
            <p>I consider myself rather a very avid modder, honestly its responsible to my interest in game design, in this work page there's going to be a lot of modding discussion and is mainly around a game called A Hat in Time, which has helped understood how game dev actually works by utlizing it in those mods.</p>
            <p>Note: All documented mods here uses custom scripts and very little visual coding (Unreal Kismet aka the bootleg Blueprint of Unreal 4).</p>
            <h2>FrostBurn Cliffs:</h1>
            <p>It's considered my "first big mod" project, a mod that tries to add environmental mechanics which gives speed, a jump boost and powers focused around ice or fire.</p>
            <p>The level is fast paced so the player suppose to utilize these mechanics to overcome the level as fast as possible.</p> 
            <p>During the development I've made a small demo which got a lot of feedback, both positive and negative, the feedback has helped me in improving the main mod itself.</p>

            <h1 id="web-dev">Web Development</h1>
            <p>Ever since High School I have done web development as a school project for a website using HTML4 (where I've used the css inside "&lt;style&gt;" ðŸ˜¬).</p>
            <p>But in all honesty, that was just the beginning, after graduating from High School in 2017 I've taken a 16 week Web Dev bootcamp called "Founders & Coders" in Nazareth, in the course I've been taught the fundementals of web development while expanding onto web frameworks like React, Node and Elm.</p>
