After years of waiting his destiny on Earth, Kyle Blackthorne has finally come home to face the galaxy's most terrifying mutant monsters and goblin hordes. With brute strength, animal cunning and a lead-spewing shotgun he's on a quest to reclaim his once peaceful Planet Tuul.

With his home world saved, Blackthorne, now roaming the world again in pursuit of his destiny, finds himself in the Nexus.

# Introducing Cards

<div align=center>
<img src=https://i.imgur.com/Rv7mV4f.jpg title="Cards">
</div>

Cards is a new system that makes unlocking new heroes much easier and more fun, this should allow players to own heroes more quickly.

Cards come in different types which can be:

* Role Cards: Grants a hero in that specific role.
* Universe Cards: Grants a hero in that specific universe.
* Wild Cards: Grants any hero.

Cards will replace hero drops from loot chests and will **allow you to unlock any unowned hero based on that Card**, if none is available the card will behave as a normal duplicate and grant shards.

Additionally new players will get the following cards as they gradually level up their new account as follows:

<div align=center>

|Level|Card Reward|Rarity Level|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|5 |Wild Card|Legendary|
|10|Tank Card|Epic|
|20|Healer Card|Epic|
|30|Bruiser Card|Epic|
|40|Ranged Assassin Card|Legendary|
|50|Support Card|Legendary|
</div>

To all our veterans and already above level 50, you will receive a role card for each role as follows:

* Legendary Ranged Assassin Card.
* Legendary Melee Assassin Card.
* Legendary Support Card.
* Epic Tank Card.
* Epic Healer Card.
* Epic Bruiser Card.

**Developer Comment:** In an attempt to make the nexus more accessible and grants more motivation to play, we came up with the Cards system! This should replace our previous level up system for new players and help them getting a nice boost in expanding their current rooster with at least 1 for each role, causing them to pretty much fill in every single role possible by playing the game normally.

**Developer Comment:** We've been looking into some of Imperius' underperforming talents and we saw some potential for some buffs, we also swapped his Level 7 talent with his Level 4 talent to make his power spike come a little earlier, allowing him to fill more roles than just a main tank.

## Thrall

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/qKnPReq.png title="Thrall">

**Talents**
* Level 20
  * **Worldbreaker (R\)**
    * New functionality: Sundering now continuous in its path indefinitely and goes around the world until Sundering gets recasted again. Each time Sundering impacts in its path, it leaves behind an impassable rift, blocking unit movement for 3 seconds.

[quote]
**Developer Comment:** “Earthquake” is more picked than “Sundering” due its heroic upgrade “Earthen Shield”, because of that, we believe “Sundering” could use a similar level 20 power spike. We're also buffing “Worldbreaker” to give Thrall a way to break both the pickrate and winrate.

[quote]
**Developer Comment:** We believe we can make more interesting talent choices for Abathur so we are replacing Evolutionary Link with a talent that will make his enemies go into suspiciousness.

**Abilities**

  * Cooldown increased from 4 to 5.
  * Additional functionality: Flash Heal applies a mark for 12 seconds, damaging an enemy Hero heals all marked allies for 32.


**Talents**

  * Bold Strategy (Q)
    * Removed.
  * **New Talent: Enlightenment (Active)**
    * Activate to cause your next Flash Heal to heal 50% around the target.
    * 30 seconds cooldown.
* Level 13
  * Push Forward! (E)
    * New functionality: Damaging an enemy Hero grants Anduin 2.5% Movement Speed for 6 seconds, up to 15%. Ally Heroes who are marked with Flash Heal benefit from this bonus.

[quote]
**Developer Comment:** Ever since Anduin’s release, Pursued by Grace has simply been underwhelming while at the same time, Bold Strategy dominated the level 1 talent tier. That leaves Renew only to be picked in very niche situations and in order to fix this, we are adding a new functionality to Flash Heal that should serve something similar to Pursued by Grace, while at it, we’ve fleshened out his talent tree a bit.

[quote]
**Developer Comment:** We believe Tyrande is in an ok place but some of her talents could use more love, we are giving Darnassian Archery an interesting buff that should allow her to heal more in the process on the risk of not picking "Celestial Attunement".

[quote]
**Developer Comment:**  As we specified in one of our Reddit posts, we agree that Falstad only having 66% chance to kill players with Lightning Rod is simply unacceptable, and we'll buff it to make sure that Falstad players will be guaranteed a kill whenever they use Lightning Rod.
