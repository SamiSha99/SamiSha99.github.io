# Nexus Anomalies {#nexusanomalies}

Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire season, allowing us time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation, some of them may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just be a limited time event.

The second Nexus Anomaly has arrived! In order to make game experiences better for the majority, we're changing how Quick Match works since its our current most played mode. Players will no longer be able to queue to any hero they desire and instead play Unranked draft.

### Quick Match

* Renamed to Draft Match.
* Players will no longer be able to queue with any hero they want, instead they will be sent to a draft where they have to pick their heroes before the game starts.

### Unranked

* Removed.

![](/assets/images/hots-april-fools/hr.png)


# General {#general}

* The victorious team is now rewarded with 10 Shards on top of the previous rewards, vs AI and Brawl matches grant 5 shards.

### Toys 2 Event

* Toys 2 Event has been extended to April 28, 2020, PT.

### Storm League

* Players who are Master and higher can play solo only.
* Players who are Diamond can play in a group of 2.
* Players who achieve Bronze 5 with 0 scored points will be unable to play Storm League for a week, afterwards they are automatically set to Bronze 3, doing so multiple times would increase the duration to Permanent.

### Design

  * 2+ Vehicles & type-heroes now count more than one hero, affecting abilities and stacks granted.
    * This change affects Cho'Gall, Triglav Protector and The Lost Vikings.


> **Developer Comment:** Storm League has been in a very weird spot the pasts few changes, to avoid boosting players more easily to Diamond especially Masters and above, we are going to limit the group queues even further to up the challenge required to climb the ladder.
