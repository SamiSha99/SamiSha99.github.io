        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is SamiSha, I am 22 year old Arab from Israel living in the Haifa District. Currently on my 3rd year in Arab
            American University of Palestine working on my <b>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</b>, I spend
            most of my time programming, problem solving and learning game developement.
