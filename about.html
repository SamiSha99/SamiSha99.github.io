        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Sami Shakkour, but I go by the online anlias SamiSha or just Sami, a 22 years old Arab-Israeli living in the Haifa District. Currently on my 3rd year in Arab
            American University of Palestine working on my <b>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</b>, I like music, swimming but I spend
            most of my time programming, problem solving and learning game development.

            I consider myself fluent and knowledgeable in a lot of programming languages in which I've used in modding, development and game dev. I also consider myself really good in web development, as an example this website was made fully by me!
