            Hello! I also go by the online alias SamiSha, you may have talked to me around the internet somewhere, an
            Arab living in
            Israel.
            Graduated from the Arab American University with a <span
                style="color: rgb(185, 131, 255);text-decoration: underline;">B.S in
                Computer Science</span>, I like music, swim and spend the rest of my time solving
            problems on my fixated projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I strive to be a learner whenever the moment gives it to me, learning a new language is not a barricade
            but merely a minor obstacle to overcome, I am proficient in JS/TS, Java/C#, C++ and Python.
        </p>
        <p>Currently working in Orb-AR, creating development tools using ThreeJS, React and TypeScript.</p>

            A communication mod that takes your actions and show it to everyone else in the lobby! The objective
            of
            this mod is to communicate without the ability to directly write into the chat therefore
            automatically
            moderated by the user. The chat box supports string formatting allowing for colorful and reactions
            to
            appear in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Has modding support implemented on top of it, allowing modders to make packs desinged to add
            localization for custom objects in their mods or translate the packs with new text entirely in other
            supported languages.

        </h2>
        <p>
            A framework made for modding puporses that allows modders to create point and click interactivity
            between the
            player and the world around them. The system is entirely built upon "Hat_HUD" a system found in the
            game
            with the addition of interactivity through actors and Kismet functionality. The implementation is
            quick and
            simple and allows a lot of customizability through changing the mouse look,
            colors when Un/Hovering and size. System interacts through "point and click" with "3D button" Actors
            that
            the player can drop in the scene and
            the rest is done through Kismet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The objective of such framework is to allow for a genre of "point and click" to be possible in the
            modding scene, this resulted in different mods using such solution, from FPS related functionality,
            to interacting with the scene and dragging.
