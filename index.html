                Hello! I also go by the online alias SamiSha, you may have talked to me on social medias, Discord or
                Forums, I am an Arab living in the Haifa District.
                Graduated from the Arab American University with a <span
                    style="color: rgb(79, 149, 255);text-decoration: underline;">B.S in
                    Computer Science</span>, I like music, swim and spend the rest of my time solving
                problems on my fixated projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I strive to be a learner whenever the moment gives it to me, learning a new language is not a barricade
                but merely a minor obstacle to overcome, I am proficient in JS/TS, Java/C#, C++ and Python.
            </p>
            <p>Currently working in Orb-AR, creating development tools using ThreeJS, React and TypeScript.</p>

                    A communication mod that takes your actions and show it to everyone else in the lobby! The objective
                    of
                    this mod is to communicate without the ability to directly write into the chat therefore
                    automatically
                    moderated by the user. The chat box supports string formatting allowing for colorful and reactions
                    to
                    appear in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Has modding support implemented on top of it, allowing modders to make packs desinged to add
                    localization for custom objects in their mods or translate the packs with new text entirely in other
                    supported languages.
