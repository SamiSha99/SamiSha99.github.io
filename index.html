            Hello! I also go by the online alias SamiSha, you may have talked to me around the internet somewhere, an
            Arab living in
            Israel.
            Graduated from the Arab American University with a <span class="highlight">B.S in
                Computer Science</span>, I am a passionate gamer, who likes music, swim and write code for my own
            projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I strive to be a learner whenever the moment gives it to me, learning a new language is not a barricade
            but merely a minor obstacle to overcome, I am proficient in JS/TS, Java/C#, C++ and Python.
        </p>
        <p>Currently <span class="highlight">working in Orb-AR</span>, creating development tools using ThreeJS, React
            and TypeScript.</p>

            A communication mod that <span class="highlight">takes your actions and communicate it to everyone
                else</span> in the lobby!
            The objective
            of
            this mod is to <span class="highlight">communicate effortlessly without a chat</span> while
            <span class="highlight">automatically
                moderated</span> by the user. The chat box supports string formatting allowing for colorful and
            reactions
            to
            appear in.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Has modding support</span> implemented on top of it, allowing modders to make packs
            desinged to add
            localization for custom objects in their mods or translate the packs with new text entirely in other
            supported languages.

        <h2>Point and Interact Framework</h2>

            onclick="OpenProjectLink(this)">Page</button>
        <p>
            A framework made for modding puporses that <span class="highlight">allows modders to create point and click
                interactivity
                between the
                player and the world around them</span>. The system is entirely built upon "Hat_HUD" a system found in
            the
            game
            with the addition of interactivity through actors and Kismet functionality. The implementation is
            quick and
            simple and <span class="highlight">allows a lot of customizability</span> through changing the mouse look,
            colors when Un/Hovering and size. System interacts through "point and click" with "3D button" Actors
            that
            the player can drop in the scene and
            the rest is done through Kismet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The objective of such framework is to <span class="highlight">allow for a genre of "point and click" to be
                possible</span> in the
            modding scene, this resulted in different mods using such solution, from FPS related functionality,
            to interacting with the scene and dragging.
